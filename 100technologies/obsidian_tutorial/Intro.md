#Learning_obsidian 
## Why using obsidian?

Well, like almost everything in life, to solve a problem. Which problem? The one relating to the knowledge conservation/preservation. Learning is no longer a problem for me, this was a result of consistently studying for over a decade in primary school, secondary school and university which is the educational level I am right now. Great, but learning something and preserve it are two different things. I need to have an easy access to all my technical knowledge, otherwise I'll have problems combining work-and-life because if I don't have this I would spend so much time learning again something that I've learned before, that is impractical.

## What it's Obsidian?

It's a **note-taking** software that lets you create plaintext - markdown files that can be reference between them. The way you can achieve this are summarize below. But if you want to see the complete documentation head over to [obsidian_help](https://help.obsidian.md/) (It's quite helpful)
- First you need to create a [[vault]] 
- Then you have to [[Create a note - search notes]]
- After that It's useful to know the basics of [[Basic markdown]] and [[Basic mermaid]] to write better notes

Knowing that is enough to start writing your own notes and organize them, so the next thing you may ask is: How can I share these notes across my devices? Well, you can use multiple platforms but I personally recommend OneDrive, why? Because it does the job, maybe there are better one's but OneDrive does the job.  
So [[How to sync your notes across devices with OneDrive]] is the natural next step.  

> But **Sync** your notes **is not** **backup** them.
