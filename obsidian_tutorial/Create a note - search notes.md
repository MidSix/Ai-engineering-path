## To create a new note:

1. Press `Ctrl+N` (or `Cmd+N` on macOS) on your keyboard. 
2. There we are, your new note has been created xd

You can also create notes and searching them by using the shortcuts:
- `ctrl + o` *(Windows)*
- `cmd + o`   *(MacOS)*

Doing that you can create a note if the name you write don't correspond to any existing note and filter notes by names. If you write the name of a folder you'll see only the notes inside that directory
